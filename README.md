# ðŸ“š Books

Books is a RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core that allows users to manage a collection of books and submit ratings.  
The API supports full CRUD operations for books and includes endpoints for users to add, update, delete, and retrieve their own ratings.  
Each book also exposes its average rating based on all submitted user ratings.
